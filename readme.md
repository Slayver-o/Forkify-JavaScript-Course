# About Forkify
---
This project is from Jonas course on Udemy.

It applied many of the things I learned in this course, such as:
- Modules
- OOP
- How to Work with Parcel
- How to Implement Project Architecture and Flotchart
- How to Work with APIs
And much, much more.

I really enjoyed this course and this great project.
